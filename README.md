# PROJECT PLAN
Plan to discuss my Capstone plans
1. Project Overview:
My story entails getting a customer's prospective on the most popular beauty products and which ones get the most sales and best reviews. It can also be used to help big name companies see how their products compare with other companies that sale similar products to give a better idea on sales trends. 
2. Technical Insights:
Pulled two datasets from Kaggle - One on the most used beauty cosmetic products with its ratings, gender target, main ingredients, category, and numbers of reviews. The other are a list of brand name products that discuss the price range, ratings, and category of product. The goal is to pull from each dataset and join the product names, the price and the reviews to get a bigger picture of the most popular beauty products!
